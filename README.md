daisyLayoutAssist
=================

A submodule to daisy which provides a GUI to link schematic and layout
in Cadence Virtuoso. This information is used to assist in layout by
showing nets and how they connect in both schematic and layout.

This can be seen as a *very* light alternative to Layout XL.

daisyLayoutAssist requires the martinnl/daisy project to be installed in order for some functions to be available. If that is not an option the relevant functions can be copied from the daisy repository.
