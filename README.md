daisyLayoutAssist
=================

A submodule to daisy which provides a GUI to link schematic and layout
in Cadence Virtuoso. This information is used to assist in layout by
showing nets and how they connect in both schematic and layout.

This can be seen as a *very* light alternative to Layout XL.
